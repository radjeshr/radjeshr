# Team Lead Playbook

Welcome! This repository is a collection of frameworks, checklists, and processes I've refined over the years while working as a **Support Manager**, **Delivery Manager**, and **Technical Project Manager**. It's designed to help build high-performing, engaged, and reliable teams — especially in fast-paced, customer-facing environments.

## What's Inside

- ✅ **Practical onboarding checklists**
- 🚨 **Clear escalation workflows**
- 📦 **Lightweight delivery framework**
- 🔁 **Rituals for team health and consistency**
- 💬 **Tips for running effective retrospectives**

Whether you're leading support, delivery, or technical operations, this playbook is built to scale and adapt.

> Let’s create clarity, ownership, and momentum — one play at a time.
