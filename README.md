# Team Lead Playbook

Welcome! This repository is a collection of frameworks, checklists, and processes I've refined over the years while working as a **Support Manager**, **Delivery Manager**, and **Technical Project Manager**. It's designed to help build high-performing, engaged, and reliable teams — especially in fast-paced, customer-facing environments.

## What's Inside

- ✅ **Practical onboarding checklists** — A comprehensive guide for successfully onboarding new team members.
- 🚨 **Escalation process templates** — Clear and actionable steps for escalating incidents and issues.
- 🧑‍💼 **Stakeholder management strategies** — Templates and tools for managing key stakeholders and ensuring successful collaborations.
- 🔄 **Delivery framework** — A lightweight framework designed to streamline the delivery process and improve efficiency.
- 📊 **Team health metrics** — Tools to assess and improve team performance and well-being.
- 💬 **Communication templates** — Ready-to-use templates for internal and external communication in service delivery.
- 🛠️ **Incident response plan** — Structured approach to handling incidents and minimizing their impact.
- 🗣 **Team rituals** — Best practices for team meetings, retrospectives, and continuous improvement.
- 🎯 **ITIL practices** — Guidance and templates for aligning processes with ITIL® best practices.

Whether you're leading support, delivery, or technical operations, this playbook is built to scale and adapt.
